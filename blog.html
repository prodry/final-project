						<h2>Written by: ELLIOT MONTANEZ<a href="http://lyricallemonade.com/author/elliotmontanez/"></a> On March 8th, 2018 <a href="#"></a></h2>

						<p style="font-size: 18px">Ajani Jones is one of the most talented artists in Chicago, you just may not know of him yet. I first discovered Ajani’s music late last year when the homie Kiraly put me on to his project “Eternal Bliss”, and after running through the EP dozens of times I became a huge fan of what he was doing. He made an appearance on our “Top 50 Chicago Projects Of 2017” list a couple months back and for good reason too, as he possess an insane amount of potential & unmatched rapping abilities.</p>
						<p style="font-size: 18px">A couple days back Ajani dropped a stellar new EP titled Cocoons, and mark my words when I say that when we look back on the year of 2018 of Chicago rap, this project will stand out in the bunch. I predict that he will become one of the faces of Chicago rap in a couple years and with his new team Closed Sessions backing him, the sky is truly the limit for Ajani.</p>
						<p style="font-size: 18px">I am excited to see where he takes it from here but for now stream this brand new tape below, take a few minutes of your time learn a thing or two about him & afterwards be to sure to give him a follow on Twitter here! <p>(photo credit – Cooper Fox)</p><a class="continue" href="#"> Continue Reading &rarr;</a></p>

<p>—</p>

<p>EM: When did you first start creating music?</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>EM: Can you speak on your relationship with producers Blookah, Quickly & Banks?</p>

<p>AJ: I was recording in my homies bedroom and they sent us over some beats and I was instantly asking “How is this guy not famous”. He sent me a bunch of futuristic and wavy beats that I didn’t touch for a year or two, until I went back to them and created a whole project.

I saw that they had the ability to help artists get to that next level with their resources, and they are fantastic with rolling out projects & have great PR. I moved back to Chicago from Iowa and told myself ” in two years I’m going to sign with Closed Sessions”, and it just so happened on the second year I did it”.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>EM: Along with the CS announcement you recently released a brand new EP titled “Cocoons”, can you speak on what the process of creating that was like.</p>

<p>AJ: It was really dope, we met with CS & they asked us where we were at with the EP we said 20% but we were really at zero. I ended up completing the entire project in less than two months. We made like twenty records for the tape and picked the ones we thought fit best. It was dope & seamless, we are on a roll over at CS, everything is running smoothly.</p>
